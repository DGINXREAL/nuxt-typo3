# Configuration
Please note that `@t3headless/nuxt-typo3` is still available as part of the Early Access Program.

**More details about the benefits will be provided soon**.

## NPM Token
If you have joined the `EAP` program, you will receive an `npm auth token` that allows you to fetch all packages from the `@t3headless` private scope. One of the available packages is nuxt-typo3-forms, which delivers support for handling forms. We will be sharing additional packages that are beneficial for composing your TYPO3 website.


## .npmrc setup

To fetch `nuxt-typo3` from `@t3headless`'s private scope, please set up an `.npmrc` file.

Export your token as a global variable:

```bash
export NPM_TOKEN=YOUR_TOKEN_HERE
```

Edit your `.npmrc` file:

::code-group
  ```bash [npm]
  @t3headless:registry=https://git.macopedia.pl/api/v4/packages/npm/
  //git.macopedia.pl/api/v4/packages/npm/:_authToken=${NPM_TOKEN}
  ```
