# Layouts
This guide shows how to use and create custom layouts in the Frontend Application.

## Backend Layouts
Backend layouts are regular Vue.js components which are responsible for rendering different `colPos` from your page response.
It assumes you have configured a backend layout for your page response:

```json
...
  "appearance": {
    "layout": "layout-1",
    "backendLayout": "singlecolumn"
  },
...
```

### Create Backend Layout

If your backend layout is called `singlecolumn`, then you should create a new file named `T3BlSinglecolumn`.

```vue [components/T3BlSinglecolumn.vue]
<template>
  <div>
    Custom Backend Layout
    <p>First column</p>
    <T3Renderer
      v-if="content?.colPos0"
      :content="content.colPos0"
    />
    <p>Second column</p>
    <T3Renderer
      v-if="content?.colPos1"
      :content="content.colPos1"
    />
  </div>
</template>

<script lang="ts" setup>
import { T3BackendLayout } from '@t3headless/nuxt-typo3'
defineProps<T3BackendLayout>()
</script>
```

::alert{type="success"}
The `T3Renderer` component is responsible for rendering all Content Elements from a specific column. 
::

::alert{type="warning"}
Please remember that your `Backend Layout` components should be accessible as global components.

## Frontend Layouts
Frontend Layouts are regular Vue.js components that you can place in the layouts directory. They are usually responsible for maintaining the main structure of the page.

It assumes you have configured a backend layout for your page response:

```json
...
  "appearance": {
    "layout": "layout-1",
    "backendLayout": "singlecolumn"
  },
...
```

### Create Frontend Layout
If your frontend layout is called `layout-1`, then you should create a new file named `layout-1` in `layouts` directory. Here is no `T3` mapping since layouts are native feature of Nuxt.

```vue [layouts/layout-1.vue]
<template>
  <div>
    <header>
      My header
    </header>    
    <slot /> <!-- Remember about the slot -->
    <footer>
      My Footer
    </footer>
  </div>
</template>
```

::alert{type="warning"}
Unlike other components, your layouts must have a single root element to allow Nuxt to apply transitions between layout changes - and this root element cannot be a `<slot />`. Please read more about layouts [here](https://nuxt.com/docs/guide/directory-structure/layouts)
