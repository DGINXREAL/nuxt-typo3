# Display Page Data

By default, Nuxt creates a basic project structure which includes an `app.vue` file. 

Replace the `<NuxtWelcome/>` component in this file with `<NuxtPage>`. This will allow you to display page data fetched from the TYPO3 API.

```vue
// app.vue
<template>
  <NuxtPage/>
</template>
```

That's all there is to it. You should now be able to see the page content. 
Next, let's move on to displaying the navigation.
