# Overriding T3 Components

To render all pages and their content elements, we use [`Dynamic Components`](https://nuxt.com/docs/guide/directory-structure/components#dynamic-components){:target="_blank"} and the `resolveComponent` method. This implies that we use them as global components. All components are loaded as lazy components.

To override module components, you must also register your content elements as global. 

By default, Nuxt registers all components as global when you place them in the `components/global` directory. However, you can configure this - the structure of your components is up to you.

## Add your components directory

Use the [`components`](https://nuxt.com/docs/api/configuration/nuxt-config#components){:target="_blank"} config to register your directory with global components.

Edit `nuxt.config.ts`:

```ts [nuxt.config.ts]
export default defineNuxtConfig({
  components: {
    dirs: [
      {
        path: '@/components/T3',
        global: true
      }
    ]
  }
})
```

Then you can save your content elements as `components/T3/T3CeText.vue`.

### Providing a Prefix
You can also configure a prefix for all T3 components:

```ts [nuxt.config.ts]
export default defineNuxtConfig({
  components: {
    dirs: [
      {
        path: '@/components/T3',
        global: true,
        prefix: 'T3'
      }
    ]
  }
})
```

Then you can save your content elements as `components/T3/CeText.vue`.
