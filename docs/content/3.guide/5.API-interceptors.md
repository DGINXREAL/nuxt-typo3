## API Interceptors

To make API requests, we use apiClient, which is a type of singleton instance. Thanks to this, you can set up common options and global interceptors for all requests made by the `nuxt-typo3` app.

All requests are handled by native fetch wrapped by [ofetch](https://github.com/unjs/ofetch)

[ofetch](https://github.com/unjs/ofetch) provides four interceptors:
::list
+ [onRequest](https://github.com/unjs/ofetch#onrequest-request-options-)
+ [onRequestError](https://github.com/unjs/ofetch#onrequesterror-request-options-error-)
+ [onResponse](https://github.com/unjs/ofetch#onresponse-request-options-response-)
+ [onResponseError](https://github.com/unjs/ofetch#onresponseerror-request-options-response-)
::

To do this, you can utilize `useT3Api` composable and `setOption` function.

```ts [plugins/setInterceptors.ts]
export default defineNuxtPlugin(() => {
  const { setOption } = useT3Api()

  setOption('onRequest', (context) => {
    console.log('on request: ', context)
  })

  setOption('onRequestError', (context) => {
    console.log('on request error: ', context)
  })

  setOption('onResponse', (context) => {
    console.log('on response: ', context)
  })

  setOption('onResponseError', (context) => {
    console.log('on response error: ', context)
  })
})
```

::alert{type="warning"}
Please note that you can only set up global interceptors once, as a second setup will override the previous one. If you wish to establish multiple interceptors, you can achieve this by integrating our solution with additional external handling.
