# i18n
nuxt-typo3 has built-in internationalization support - the current language is detected based on the current route and [i18n](/introduction/options#i18n) settings. 
For example, if you've defined in i18n settings: 
```js
typo3: {
  i18n: {
    default: 'en',
    locales: ['en', 'pl']
  }
},
```

* Route: http://website.com/about - English language, we don't add the language code as it's the default.
* Route: http://website.com/pl/o-nas - Polish language, detected by the "pl" code indicating it's Polish. Is looking for `o-nas` page.
* Route: http://website.com/de/uber-uns - English language - as you didn't define the 'de' language in the language codes array and `de/uber-uns` is treated as a full path of the requested page.

nuxt-typo3 doesn't have built-in label translation support - you can provide it through `InitialData`. If you wish to keep labels on the frontend side of the application, use [nuxt-i18n](/integrations/usenuxti18n).
